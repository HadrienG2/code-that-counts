# Multithreading (WIP)

TODO: Start with mutex and contended atomic, then go all the way to a parallel
      binary reduction tree for the final merging, with join-and-sum as an
      intermediary easy hack. May also benefit from sub-parts. Do not miss cheap
      shot on hyperthreading, but only after making sure we can't use it to
      put those integer ALUs to good use :)
